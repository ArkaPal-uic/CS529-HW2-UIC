# Acknowledgements:
The support code for this repository was created by Andrew Wentzel, who is a member of the evl lab at UIC.

# Process:
- Created a composite glyph with a circle at the vertex of each arrow. The radii of these circles are directly mapped to the concentration.
- 70% of the "fingers" are filtered out by default, going by the question.
- The user can set a custom concentration to filter by, in the text-box. The colour-scale and legend change with the concentration provided.
